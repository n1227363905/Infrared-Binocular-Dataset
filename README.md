# Infrared Binocular Dataset (IBD)

#Dataset Overview

The Infrared Binocular Dataset (IBD) is a comprehensive dataset designed for research and development in the field of infrared imaging and computer vision. It contains a rich collection of infrared images captured by binocular cameras, which can be utilized for a variety of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, and depth estimation in infrared scenarios.

The dataset has been uploaded to Baidu Cloud consists. Download Link:[https://pan.baidu.com/s/1h974-UA_EoExZ1AYMi4hsQ]. (Notice: The relevant data involves internal scenarios. Please contact [liulimin1023@163.com] and specify your purpose to obtain the extraction code.)

#Dataset Content

The dataset contains 374 groups of stereorectified binocular infrared image sequences and their corresponding left-eye image disparity maps. The data was sampled in campuses and residential areas, with acquisition scenarios including environments such as libraries, teaching buildings, and parking lots. Meanwhile, campuses and residential areas also feature different background elements like trees, roads, and walls. This dataset was generated through four steps: data acquisition, equipment calibration, infrared image processing, and disparity generation, ultimately resulting in the ground-truth of left-eye image disparity maps annotated by LiDAR point clouds.

#Applications

Autonomous Driving: Assist in developing infrared - based perception systems for autonomous vehicles, especially in low - visibility conditions.
Robotics: Enable robots to perceive and interact with the environment in infrared-dominated scenarios, such as in industrial inspection or search-and-rescue operations.
Computer Vision Research: Provide valuable resources for researchers to explore new algorithms and techniques in infrared image analysis, such as depth map generation and disparity estimation.
